# rock-paper-scissors

This project has been given by The Odin Project cirriculum. It is meant to give me experience in Javascript by making a rock, paper, scissors game. 
This game will be played entirely in the console. 

To play, simply launch the console in your browsers dev tools. 
You will be asked for your selection via a prompt dialogue box. 
You will play 5 rounds against a computer player. 
Whoever has the highest score after 5 rounds is the winner.
